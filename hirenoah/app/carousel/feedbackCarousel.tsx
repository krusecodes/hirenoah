            <Paragraph style={contentStyle}>&quot;Noah started out at Aspire in a non-technical role and pursued his goals to become a software developer, successfully transitioning into an engineering role here. He is bright and learns quickly from a technical standpoint, but where he really impresses me is with his product engineering and leadership qualities. Noah cares about delivering great experiences to customers, engages with product managers and designers, and is proactive about making the team better. I highly recommend Noah for being an amazing teammate and person, and I{"'"}m confident that he will make the culture of any team he joins better.&quot; -Suhaas Prasad, CTO & Cofounder at Aspire</Paragraph>

            <Paragraph style={contentStyle}>&quot;Noah is truly a remarkable individual. I first met Noah when he was aspiring to transition into an engineering role and he quickly impressed me (and everyone at work) with his ability to learn quickly. He's organized, dependable and goal oriented. Over the coarse of the next 3 years, I got to witness him graduate from an intense coding bootcamp while working his day job. He completed a split time internship with the engineering team and then successfully interviewed for and received an offer for a software engineering position at Aspire. Fast forward to present day, Noah has grown to be a confident, young talent who carries his listen-first approach and curious nature wherever he's involved. He's cemented himself as one of the most knowledgeable individuals about the core product and he's even won a few company hack-a-thons. The future is bright, I'm staying tuned.&quot; -Samir Chugh, Engineering Manager at Zoox</Paragraph>
